# py_pandas
Hi, I'm Frances.

I'm dealing with a project used VBA to develop macro/add-on in Excel.
And the VBA program is almost done by now.

The first version of this macro/add-on project is:
  based on python & VS Code.
  used pkgs: pandas & numpy.

After several days of thinking, 
I decided to keep my leetcoding within the web station, and keep it secret for now.

So I changed the title of this repositry into py_pandas.
I decided to continue my learning & practising with pandas, since it's widely used and perfectly performed in data processing.

good luck with me!
